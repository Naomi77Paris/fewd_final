                    <p class="text-faded">My education includes a 4-year bachelors degree in Physical Education from Ege University, where I graduated third in my class. I moved to the United States from my hometown of Izmir, Turkey in 2006.</p><br>

                    <p class="text-faded">I have been working as a fitness instruction for over 10 years. I was a     college basketball player and basketball coach and have former students that have played for the Turkish national team. My background includes swimming instruction, step-aerobics and dance. I have also appeared on TV for fitness and exercise programming. Personal activities that are important to me include salsa, argentine tango, and crossfit. But nothing fills me with more happiness, joy and love than my 2-year old son Jackson.</p><br>

                    <p class="text-faded">Nothing makes me happier than seeing my clients reach their goals and feel good about themselves.</p>

                    <p class="testimonials_par">I worked with Nev for some time. For me, the most important thing was that she really knew how to vary our workouts so they never became boring. She also challenged me in a way that I found comfortable but... very challenging!! Nev knows a lot about exercise physiology and shares her knowledge in practial, usable ways. After I finished an hour or so with her, I was defintiely done - a good thing! She worked me hard, but made it fun.<br>

                    I'd happily recommend Nev to anybody looking for a supportive, but challenging trainer who knows enough to really help you achieve your goals. Bonus - she's funny!! - Jeff.

                    <p class="testimonials_par">Nevrize Aydogen is the best trainer I've ever worked with! That's a big statment, but it's 100% from the heart. I've worked with 5 different trainers over the past 10 years and many Pilates instructors. Why is Nevrize special? She is an expert in what she does with a 1,000 ways of working a particular muscle group. She's always learning new techniques to share so you don't get bored. Every workout is special. She starts you out slowly so you don't get overly sore or injured. She customizes the workout for you-no one size fits all as with past trainers. She watches your every move and posture to make sure you're doing the exercises correctly and not open to injury. Most trainers I've found in the past let their attention wander as they talk about other things or watch others in the gym. She cares! She is a truly caring person who cares about your fitness and your goals. She is a rare gem among personal trainers. I highly recommend Nevrize no matter what your fitness level is. The first step is the hardest and she helps you take the first step by inviting you to be your best. - Alice
                    </p>
                </div>


                <div class="home-info-block wd">
                    <p class="testimonials_par">Nevrize is truly one of a kind. After years of repeated physical injuries from work and outdoor play, I found myself overweight and well under a decent fitness level for a 39 year old woman. I had never employed a personal trainer, but was to the point where I was willing to give it a try and hope to find someone who really knew their stuff. Hoenstly, I'm still unsure where the four-leaf clover was stuck to me when I found Nev's ad. During the very first workout I knew she was a rare find.</br>

                    Nev has a wealth of knowledge partnered with a great sense of humor and an honest desire for those she works with to succeed. Her humor, timing and upbeat attitude make workouts go by so fast the only way you know time is passing is by the sweat on your brow. The check-ins between workouts are very encouraging and have been above and beyond. Nev's dedication and commitment are inspirational and help keep my goals in focus. After 10 sessions with her, my fitness level has increased more than I thought it could in such a short time. I'm looking forward to continuing our work together knowing that I have a solid advocate for my highest level of fitness possible. The only downside: It won't be long before everyone looking for an outstanding personal trainer will be hearing Nev's name. - LeAnne</p>

                <div class="home-info-block fe">
                    <p class="testimonials_par"> just started working with Nevrize after finding her on Craigslist. I was desperate to feel better about myself by losing weight, but I was having a hard time doing it on my own. When I emailed Nev for the first time I instantly liked her, and her schedule and fee was just what I was looking for. ( It seemed too good to be true!) She was very excited to meet me and very accomodating when I was setting up my appt. with her. The first time we met to discuss what my workouts would look like if I chose to hire her she was so encouraging and excited to help me feel better about myself. I was totally sold on wanting to work with her! You can really tell that she not only loves what she does, but she loves helping people (especially women) reach their goal to be healthy. That is what I admired the most. - JoAnne

                    <p class="testimonials_par">I've been working out with her almost 8 months and I've never felt this strong and healthy before. She always uses different methods and tools. She designs exercises only for me and pushes my limit every time. I've already lost 4 pounds since starting with Nevrize and my clothes are fitting differently. Also, she's also been working with my 8 year son for swimming and basketball, and that's been wonderful too. Highly recommended trainer. Thank you Nevrize! - Tom</p>
